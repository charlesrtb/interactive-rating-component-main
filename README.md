## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Javscript

### What I learned

My biggest learning experience with this project was working with Javascript. This is the first project I have used Javascript outside of tutorials. I wasn't aware of using For loops to iterate over the radio buttons in order to check which one was selcted and return its' value. 

Another challenge was using radio buttons and styling these using CSS to match the brief. I wanted to use radio buttons because I felt this would be semantically correct, perhaps.

### Continued development

The next stage in development is to just continue with more Javascript focused prohects whislt also improving on my HTML and CSS knowledge and skills.
